@notice A one-time panic button for pausable contracts
@dev GateSeal is an one-time immediate emergency pause for pausable contracts.
     It must be operated by a multisig committee, though the code does not
     perform any such checks. Bypassing the DAO vote, GateSeal pauses 
     the contract(s) immediately for a set duration, e.g. one week, which gives
     the DAO the time to analyze the situation, decide on the course of action,
     hold a vote, implement fixes, etc. GateSeal can only be used once.
     GateSeal assumes that they have the permission to pause the contracts.

     GateSeals are only a temporary solution and will be deprecated in the future,
     as it is undesireable for the protocol to rely on a multisig. This is why
     each GateSeal has an expiry date. Once expired, GateSeal is no longer
     usable and a new GateSeal must be set up with a new multisig committee. This
     works as a kind of difficulty bomb, a device that encourages the protocol
     to get rid of GateSeals sooner rather than later.

     In the context of GateSeals, sealing is synonymous with pausing the contracts,
     sealables are pausable contracts that implement `pauseFor(duration)` interface.
